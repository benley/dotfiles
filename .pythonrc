# This makes tab-completion work in interactive python interpreters, as long
# as they are compiled with gnu readline support. If not, python will still
# work, just without tab completion.

  import readline

  print "Module readline not available."
else:
  import rlcompleter
  # This works on linux
  readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")
  # And this works on osx. Weird.
